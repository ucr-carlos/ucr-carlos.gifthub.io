        <p class="lead mb-4">My current professional experience so far consists of working at a concert venue and a retail store. Toward the end of May and start of June of 2022 I started to work at the Hollywood Bowl. The Hollywood Bowl is a concert venue that has been known for a long time. Some major concerts that had occurred while i worked there was Billie Eilish, Dave Chapelle, and others. I started off as a usher where I would welcome guests and provided seat assistance, creating a warm and organized arrival experience, verify and process tickets for venue entry, maintaining accurate crowd management and high levels of crowd control, provide clear communication to guests regarding event schedules, locations, and upcoming events, and ensure event safety by monitoring patron activity and addressing potential issues, prioritizing security and well-being. I lasted about 3 months in the usher position but then decided to switch over to being a "cushion cashier.<br><br>

        I still worked at the Hollywood Bowl but decided to switch positions because the benefits were sounding better and the job definitely was easier. As a cushion cashier I would efficiently manage large volumes of payments and the distribution of supplies to hundreds of guests while demonstrating excellent customer service in a fast-paced environment, maintain a flawless record of accuracy, processing over 100 transactions per day with 100% accuracy, demonstrating error-free payments and change issuance, monitor concurrent guest count and coordinated transportation to prevent overcrowding and prioritize guest experience, and collaborate with the venue staff to optimize patron seating, ensuring efficient and seamless entry for a smooth audience experience. The cushion cashier position was for th e rest of the Sumer season which was June to November of 2022. The benefits that came with switching positions was a higher wage, longer paid break, not as enforced rules, and I would occasionally get tip money from patrons. It was a good idea move positions because all these benefits made work more enjoyable and influenced me to want to go to work rather than feel forced. After the season ended I decided to take a break year of working because it was my final year of High school and I really wanted to enjoy it.<br><br>

       I recently went back into the job area and went back into the Hollywood Bowl but now as a different position then any of the ones before. I became a bus dispatcher where i would mainly give park-and-ride patrons instructions as to where to go at the end of the night in order to catch their bus. After that small amount of time where the complete buses would stop arriving, my break was given to me and I would come back later at night to monitor concurrent guest count and coordinate transportation to prevent overcrowding and prioritize guest experience. This is the current job I am finishing to work at and I also decided to apply at a retail shoe store that has been a great experience so far. That is my professional bio.
